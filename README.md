#### Style guide

- Use four spaces, not tabs.
- Pretty-print your code before pushing it.
- Please don't use inline styles, make separate CSS file for different sections.
- Use webp for images.
- DONT USE BRs FOR NEWLINES - use `<p>` tags, make divs, or use CSS
  `white-space: pre`.
- If you're adding an asset or page then check if it's already there before
  adding it.
